Go(lang) Canonical S-expression Parser
======================================

* [source](https://bitbucket.org/shanehanna/csexp)

## Description.

A Go canonical S-expression parser.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Go >= 1.0

### Install

```
go get bitbucket.org/shanehanna/csexp
```

## TODO

* TODO: Examples in docs.
* Would be nice to handle regular s-expressions as well.
* The Parser expression scope code is awkward.
* The Parser atom types suck. `type Bytes []byte; type Expression []Atomizer` ?

## Contributing

Go nuts! I do not care if you write tests or comment code. If you write
something neat just send a pull request, tweet, email or yell it at me line by
line in person. I will do whatever extra work is required.
